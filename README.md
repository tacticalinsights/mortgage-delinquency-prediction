# Mortgage Delinquency Prediction

## Overview

A mortgage delinquency predictor that utilizes data science techniques to analyze historical mortgage data and predict delinquency. This project aims to provide valuable insights for risk assessment for investors in the mortgage industry.

The predictor leverages a comprehensive dataset comprising millions of mortgage records. The dataset includes essential information such as borrower demographics, loan details, credit scores, and payment history. This rich and diverse dataset serves as a solid foundation for building robust prediction models.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing pipeline that handles data partitioning, missing values, and feature encoding to ensure the data is ready for model training.
- **Visualization:** Includes visualizations - histograms, scatter plots, violin plots, and heatmaps - tailored to provide insights into feature distributions, trends, and aid in understanding latent inter-feature relationships.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Employs over 30 machine learning algorithms from baseline Logistic Regression to fine-tuned Gradient Boosting, to build predictive models that can effectively identify borrowers at risk of delinquency.
- **Model Evaluation:** Incorporates robust model evaluation techniques, including cross-validation and performance metrics such as F1-score and ROC AUC score to assess the model's performance and ensure its reliability.

## Usage
